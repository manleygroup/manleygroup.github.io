    rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have
    any incomplete personal data about you completed.
</p>
<p>
    8.5 In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your
    personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: [the
    personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which
    they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to
    consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules
    of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing
    purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed]. However,
    there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions
    include where processing is necessary: [for exercising the right of freedom
    of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or
    for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims].
</p>
<p>
    8.6 In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of
    your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of
    the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no
    longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you
    require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
    claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of
    that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may
    continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise
    process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence
    of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or
    legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
</p>
<p>
    8.7 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on
    grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that
    the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for:
    the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
    exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the
    legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an
    objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can
    demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override
    your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the
    establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
</p>
<p>
    8.8 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data
    for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing
    purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your
    personal data for this purpose.
</p>
<p>
    8.9 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data
    for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on
    grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is
    necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public
    interest.
</p>
<p>
    8.10 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal
    data is:
</p>
<p>
    (a) consent; or
</p>
<p>
    (b) that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to
    which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to
    entering into a contract,
</p>
<p>
    and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right
    to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and
    machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would
    adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
</p>
<p>
    8.11 If you consider that our processing of your personal information
    infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint
    with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so
    in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or
    the place of the alleged infringement.
</p>
<p>
    8.12 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal
    information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any
    time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the
    withdrawal.
</p>
<p>
    8.13 You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data
    [by written notice to us] OR [by <em>[methods]</em>][, in addition to the
    other methods specified in this Section 8].

<p>
    This is a standard website or web app privacy policy, which will help you
    to comply with data protection legislation, and has been updated for the
    General Data Protection Regulation (also known as the GDPR).
</p>
<p>
    This policy covers the following matters (amongst others): the collection
    of personal information; the use of that personal information; the legal
    bases for the processing of that information; disclosures of that personal
    information to third parties; international transfers of personal
    information; and the use of cookies on the website.
</p>
<p>
    This document might not be suitable for you if the ways in which you use
    personal information are complex or unusual.
</p>
<p>
    In any event, there are many aspects to data protection compliance.
    Publishing a privacy policy or statement containing the relevant
    information is only one aspect - albeit an important aspect - of
    compliance.

    Section 3: How we use your personal data
</p>
<p>
    Article 13(1) of the GDPR provides that:
</p>
<p>
    "(1) Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the
    data subject, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are
    obtained, provide the data subject with all of the following information:
    ... (c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are
    intended as well as the legal basis for the processing; (d) where the
    processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests
    pursued by the controller or by a third party".
</p>
<p>
    Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR provides that:
</p>
<p>
    "(1) Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one
    of the following applies: ... (f) processing is necessary for the purposes
    of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party,
    except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental
    rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of
    personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child."
</p>
<p>
    Section 3.1
</p>
<p>
    Article 14 of the GDPR, which applies where personal information is not
    obtained from the data subject, provides that information about "the
    categories of personal data concerned" must be supplied to data subjects.
</p>
<p>
    Article 13 of the GDPR, which applies where personal information is
    obtained from the data subject, does not include an equivalent provision.
</p>
<p>
    Nonetheless, we have included references to general categories of data in
    this document, because this facilitates the identification of particular
    purposes of processing and the legal bases of processing - information
    which does need to be provided under Article 13.

    fundamental rules of the regime:
</p>
<p>
    "Personal data shall be: ... kept in a form which permits identification of
    data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which
    the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer
    periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving
    purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
    or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to
    implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures
    required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms

<p>
    Section 8: Your rights
</p>
<p>
    Article 13(2) of the GDPR provides that, where personal data is collected
    from a data subject, certain information about data subject rights must be
    provided:
</p>
<p>
    "In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller
    shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data
    subject with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and
    transparent processing: ... (b) the existence of the right to request from
    the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or
    restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to
    processing as well as the right to data portability; (c) where the
    processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article
    9(2), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without
    affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its
    withdrawal; ...".
</p>
<p>
    Similar provisions are set out in Article 14 in relation to personal data
    which is not collected from the relevant data subject.
</p>
<p>
    Section 8.3
</p>
<p>
    The right to access is set out in Article 15 of the GDPR.
</p>
<p>
    Section 8.4
</p>
<p>
    The right to rectification is set out in Article 16 of the GDPR.
</p>
<p>
    Section 8.5
</p>
<p>
    The right to erasure (or right to be forgotten) is set out in Article 17 of
    the GDPR, and must be notified to data subjects under Articles 13(2)(b),
    14(2)(c) and 15(1)(e) of the GDPR.
</p>
<p>
    Consider modifying the highlighted circumstances and exclusions, depending
    upon what will be most relevant to your processing.
</p>
<p>
    Section 8.6
</p>
<p>
    Article 18(1) of the GDPR states:
</p>
<p>
    "The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller
    restriction of processing where one of the following applies: (a) the
    accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a
    period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
    (b) the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of
    the personal data and requests the restriction of their use instead; (c)
    the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the
    processing, but they are required by the data subject for the
    establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; (d) the data subject
    has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) pending the
    verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override
    those of the data subject.
</p>
<p>
    Section 8.7
</p>

    officer in any case where: (a) the processing is carried out by a public
    authority or body, except for courts acting in their judicial capacity; (b)
    the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of
    processing operations which, by virtue of their nature, their scope and/or
    their purposes, require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects
    on a large scale; or (c) the core activities of the controller or the
    processor consist of processing on a large scale of special categories of
    data pursuant to Article 9 and personal data relating to criminal
    convictions and offences referred to in Article 10."
</p>

    "(1) Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the
    data subject, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are
    obtained, provide the data subject with all of the following information
    ... (b) the contact details of the data protection officer, where
    applicable".
